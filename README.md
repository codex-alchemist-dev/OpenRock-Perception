# OpenRock-Perception

Line-of-sight plus decaying threat memory - losing sight of a threat means "investigate the last-known spot," never instant omniscience or instant amnesia.

Part of the [OpenRock](https://github.com/codex-alchemist-dev/OpenRock) Minecraft Bedrock mod-packaging ecosystem - a Codex Alchemist project, under Fireball Everything. Consumed as a real git submodule at `libs/perception` in the main OpenRock repo, and directly `npm require`/`import`-able (real top-level CommonJS exports, esbuild-CJS/ESM-interop-compatible) by any mod's own build-time kernel registration or real in-game script.
